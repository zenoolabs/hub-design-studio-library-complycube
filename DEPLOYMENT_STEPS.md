# Deployment Steps for hub-design-studio-library-complycube

## Repository Setup and Push to GitHub

Since I cannot create remote repositories directly, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/zenoolabs
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `hub-design-studio-library-complycube`
4. Description: "Hub Design Studio Library - ComplyCube company lookup integration"
5. Set as Public or Private (as per your organization policy)
6. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Local Repository to GitHub

Run these commands from the repository directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /apps/hub-design-studio-library-complycube

# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/zenoolabs/hub-design-studio-library-complycube.git

# Rename main branch to match GitHub default
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Repository

After pushing, verify at: https://github.com/zenoolabs/hub-design-studio-library-complycube

### Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if available)

If you have GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated:

```bash
# From the repository directory
cd /apps/hub-design-studio-library-complycube

# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create zenoolabs/hub-design-studio-library-complycube --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Or for private repository
gh repo create zenoolabs/hub-design-studio-library-complycube --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Current Repository Status

- **Local repository**: `/apps/hub-design-studio-library-complycube`
- **Branch**: `master` (will be renamed to `main` during push)
- **Commits**: 2 commits ready to push
  - Initial ComplyCube integration
  - Repository restructuring with proper naming
- **Files ready**: All TypeScript code, configurations, and documentation

## Next Steps After GitHub Repository Creation

1. **Set up CI/CD** (if needed for your workflow)
2. **Configure branch protection rules**
3. **Add team members** with appropriate permissions
4. **Create release tags** for version management
5. **Update any internal documentation** to reference the new repository
